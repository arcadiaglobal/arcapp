## Reporting a Vulnerability

Report any vulnerability related to the project's functions directly from the chat in our site or wirte to us at sec@.

If you are certain that the problem can be replicated in the original @alphawallet code, still give us the change to validate it and add additional info for AW's developers.

We don't have an official bug bounty program yet, but is sure in the plans. You can count on the project's gratitude.
